# Pac-Man AI

#### Overview
Used a variety of techniques to train several Pac-Man AIs including Depth-Limited Minimax, Reinforcement Learning, Bayesâ€™ Nets, Particle Filtering, and Neural Networks. Focus on the foundational concepts of AI which underly real-world applications.

## Projects
### Search
Implementation of depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pac-Man world.

### Multi-Agent Search
Classic Pac-Man is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Implemented multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.

### Reinforcement Learning
Implementation of model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to Gridworld, Pac-Man, and a simulated crawling robot.

### Tracking
Utilized probabilistic inference in a hidden Markov model to track the movement of hidden ghosts in the Pac-Man world. Exacted inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters.

### Machine Learning
Implementation of the perceptron algorithm and neural network models. Applied the models to several tasks including digit classification.
